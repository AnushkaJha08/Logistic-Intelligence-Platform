# Logistic-Intelligence-Platform
**A Predictive Delivery, Cost Intelligence, and Optimization Dashboard**

## Overview
The **NexGen Logistics Intelligence Platform** is an end-to-end data-driven system designed to transform logistics operations from **reactive to predictive**.  
It leverages **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **Machine Learning** to analyze delivery performance, optimize routes and fleets, predict delays, and identify cost leakages across operations.

This project aligns with NexGen’s vision to:
- Build a **data-driven decision-making culture**
- **Improve customer experience** significantly
- **Reduce operational costs** by 15–20%
- Become a leader in **innovation and sustainability**

## Key Features

### Predictive Delivery Optimizer
- Machine Learning model predicts **delivery delays** using past performance and operational data.  
- Suggests **corrective actions** like route adjustments or fleet reassignment.

### Cost Intelligence Module
- Analyzes **cost breakdowns** (fuel, labor, maintenance, packaging, insurance, etc.)  
- Detects **cost leakage** and suggests **optimization opportunities**.  
- Tracks trends in **total cost per route, vehicle, and warehouse**.

### Dynamic Fleet & Route Optimization
- Recommends **optimal routes** based on distance, traffic, and weather conditions.  
- Matches **available vehicles** to delivery needs considering capacity and efficiency.  
- Displays route efficiency metrics and CO₂ footprint.

###  Customer Experience Insights
- Analyzes **feedback ratings and sentiment** to identify **at-risk customers**.  
- Correlates satisfaction with delivery performance and order priorities.

### Sustainability Metrics
- Tracks and visualizes **CO₂ emissions**, **fuel efficiency**, and **green performance**.  
- Encourages **eco-friendly logistics planning**.
